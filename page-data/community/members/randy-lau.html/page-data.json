If he could tell someone just starting their coding journey three things, they would be 1) The baseball player with the highest hitting percentage in history did not get a hit 60% of the time. Frustration, feeling lost, and failing during this journey are normal. Take a break or get some sleep, and you can try again later. Smile, as that is a good thing. 2) Become comfortable with feeling uncomfortable and working with the unfamiliar; it will be one of your superpowers. 3) Open source is an amazing, supportive, and welcoming place on the internet that invites all programmers to participate, regardless of where they are in their coding journey. If you have not gone there yet, stop reading this and go there now.","executive_bio":null,"image_path":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2f8ee12d0891c514096054cfefc32df6/24f3d/randy-chilau.png","srcSet":"/static/2f8ee12d0891c514096054cfefc32df6/10479/randy-chilau.png 115w,\n/static/2f8ee12d0891c514096054cfefc32df6/b7af2/randy-chilau.png 230w,\n/static/2f8ee12d0891c514096054cfefc32df6/24f3d/randy-chilau.png 460w","sizes":"(min-width: 460px) 460px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2f8ee12d0891c514096054cfefc32df6/f8466/randy-chilau.webp 115w,\n/static/2f8ee12d0891c514096054cfefc32df6/84992/randy-chilau.webp 230w,\n/static/2f8ee12d0891c514096054cfefc32df6/b5c5b/randy-chilau.webp 460w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 460px) 460px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":500}},"extension":"jpeg","publicURL":"/static/2f8ee12d0891c514096054cfefc32df6/randy-chilau.jpeg"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/community/members/randy-lau"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3750885592","4047814605"],"slicesMap":{},"matchPath":"/community/members/randy-lau"}
