You write your application in your favourite languages like Rust, C or C++. Then, build and compile them into a WebAssembly binary targeting the host environment. The generated binary requires the WebAssembly runtime to provide the necessary interfaces to system calls for the binary to execute. Conceptually, this is similar to JVM.
